# prework-html-css

Copy a page for ironhack's prework 

The pink stripes on the title are only shown from 1440px screens and up, I'm reading about making SVG responsive to not break the design. The rest of the page is responsive, taking out the flowers.

Regarding the flowers I found (or at least I guessðŸ˜…) the same type, cherry blossoms. I look up and edited some pics to make it more like the ones on the example.

I also included the links to the original pages but the other links were broken so I ommited them. The result on my screen is this:

<img width="100%" alt="main-page" src="https://i.imgur.com/99cUhVX.png">
