            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>
              Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
              browser-specific tags, incompatible <span>DOM</span>s, broken
              <span>CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
              achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
              <span>W3C</span>, <span>WaSP</span>, and the major browser
              creators.
            </p>

              The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the
              important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn
              to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating
              fashion. Become one with the web.

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>
              There is a continuing need to show the power of <span>CSS</span>.
              The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
              participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the
              list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very
              page. The <span>HTML</span> remains the same, the only thing that
              has changed is the external <span>CSS</span> file. Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style
              of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a
              way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly
              be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
              the beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
              contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it
              further.

            <p>
              Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying
              this page, so strong <span>CSS</span> skills are necessary too,
              but the example files are commented well enough that even
              <span>CSS</span> novices can use them as starting points. Please
              see the <a>CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips
              on working with <span>CSS</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
              <span>HTML</span>. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve
              never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn
              more, and use the sample files as a guide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Download the sample <a>HTML</a> and <a>CSS</a> to work on a copy
              locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please,
              don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your
              <span>CSS</span> file to a web server under your control.
              <a>Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all
              associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it
              and place it on our server.
